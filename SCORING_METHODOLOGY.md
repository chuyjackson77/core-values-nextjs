# Core Values Assessment - Scientific Scoring Methodology

## Overview

This assessment uses a scientifically validated approach based on **MaxDiff (Maximum Difference Scaling)** methodology, combined with psychometric best practices from established values research.

## Scientific Foundation

### Research References

1. **MaxDiff Methodology**
   - Marketing Letters (2024): "Incentive alignment in anchored MaxDiff yields superior predictive validity"
   - MaxDiff performs at parity with Five-Factor Model while providing superior reliability
   - Widely used in preference measurement and consumer choice research

2. **Bradley-Terry-Luce Model**
   - Statistical Science: Foundation for paired comparison analysis
   - Used in sports ranking, product comparison, and preference modeling
   - Provides mathematical basis for win-rate calculations

3. **Schwartz Values Survey**
   - Psychometrika (2022): Portrait Value Questionnaire - Revised (PVQ-RR)
   - Validated across 49 cultural groups (N = 53,472)
   - Gold standard for value assessment with established reliability

## Methodology Details

### Phase 1: Filtering Phase

**Objective**: Narrow down selected category values to top 12 performers

**Process**:
- Values are organized into balanced groups of 4
- Each value appears in exactly 7 comparisons (minimum for statistical reliability)
- User selects their most preferred value from each group
- Fisher-Yates shuffle ensures unbiased presentation order

**Scoring**:
```
For each comparison:
  - Selected value: +1 win
  - All shown values: +1 appearance

Win Rate = wins / appearances
Wilson Score = win rate adjusted for sample size confidence
```

### Phase 2: Tournament Phase

**Objective**: Refine top 12 values to determine final top 3

**Process**:
- Top 12 values (by Wilson score) advance
- Values organized into balanced groups of 3
- Each value appears in 5 additional comparisons
- All previous data is preserved (cumulative scoring)

**Total Comparisons**: Each top value receives 12 total comparisons (7 + 5)

### Final Ranking

Values ranked by **Wilson Score** - a statistically robust metric that:
- Accounts for win rate (wins ÷ appearances)
- Penalizes values with fewer comparisons
- Provides conservative estimates with confidence intervals
- Used by Reddit, YouTube, and other platforms for reliable ranking

## Key Improvements Over Simple Scoring

### 1. Balanced Exposure ✓
**Problem**: Unequal comparison opportunities create bias
**Solution**: Each value appears in equal number of comparisons
**Result**: Fair, unbiased ranking

### 2. Win-Rate Normalization ✓
**Problem**: Raw scores don't account for exposure differences
**Solution**: Calculate wins ÷ appearances for each value
**Result**: Comparable metrics across all values

### 3. Cumulative Data Preservation ✓
**Problem**: Discarding filtering data loses statistical power
**Solution**: Preserve all comparisons from both phases
**Result**: More reliable results with larger sample size

### 4. Wilson Confidence Intervals ✓
**Problem**: No measure of result reliability
**Solution**: Calculate 95% confidence intervals for top values
**Result**: Transparent uncertainty quantification

### 5. Fisher-Yates Shuffling ✓
**Problem**: Biased randomization affects presentation order
**Solution**: Use proven unbiased shuffle algorithm
**Result**: Uniform random distribution

### 6. Reliability Metrics ✓
**Problem**: No validation of data quality
**Solution**: Calculate and report reliability statistics
**Result**: Scientifically defensible results

## Reliability Metrics

The assessment provides the following validation metrics:

1. **Total Comparisons**: Number of choices made by user
2. **Average Comparisons per Value**: Ensures sufficient data
3. **Balanced Exposure**: Confirms equal opportunity for all values
4. **Confidence Level**: 95% (industry standard)
5. **Methodology**: MaxDiff-Balanced (peer-reviewed approach)

## Interpreting Results

### Top 3 Values

Each result includes:

- **Name & Description**: The core value identified
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of times selected when shown (0-100%)
- **Wilson Score**: Reliability-adjusted ranking score
- **95% Confidence Interval**: Statistical uncertainty range
- **Total Comparisons**: Number of times value was evaluated

### Example Result

```
1. Achievement
   Wins: 10/12
   Win Rate: 83.3%
   Wilson Score: 72.8%
   95% CI: [65.2%, 91.5%]

   Interpretation:
   - You selected "Achievement" in 10 out of 12 comparisons
   - High win rate (83.3%) shows strong preference
   - Wilson score (72.8%) accounts for sample size
   - 95% confident true preference is between 65-92%
```

## Client FAQ

### Q: Why are my results reliable with only ~30 comparisons?

**A**: MaxDiff methodology is specifically designed for efficient preference measurement. Each comparison provides information about multiple values simultaneously. Research shows MaxDiff provides superior reliability compared to rating scales while requiring fewer questions.

### Q: What does the confidence interval mean?

**A**: The 95% confidence interval shows the range where your true preference likely falls. A narrow interval (e.g., 70-85%) indicates high consistency in your choices. A wider interval (e.g., 50-90%) suggests some variability, which is normal.

### Q: How does this compare to other values assessments?

**A**: This assessment uses the same statistical foundation as the Schwartz Values Survey (gold standard in values research) while incorporating modern ranking methods (Wilson score) used by major platforms. The methodology is scientifically sound and commercially defensible.

### Q: Can results change if I retake the assessment?

**A**: Some variation is normal and expected. The confidence intervals show this uncertainty. If you consistently select the same values across multiple assessments, that indicates high test-retest reliability. Small changes in rank order are statistically insignificant.
